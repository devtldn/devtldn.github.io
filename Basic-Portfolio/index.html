            Hello! As you may already have noticed, my name is Sean. Welcome to my page. I enjoy coding as much as I can as I try to turn thoughts into things.
            <br><br>
            I studied Computer Information Systems in college with no strong interest in coding as I confronted endless counts of
            faillures--but here I am now... Witness the great (and not-so-great) journey as I aim to become a full-fledged developer!
            <br><br>
            Feel free to contact me using the form in the upper-righthand corner as I will do my best to follow-up. If I do not get back to you within the
            24 hours of your inquiry, I am probably stressed out, binge watching on Netflix, eating my life away, or all three. I look forward to hearing from you soon!
        </p>
